It makes the text that you are writing very readable. Text in HTML documents can be hard to read. If you are trying to compose sentences that make sense, it's nice not to have a lot of syntax around it. </p>\n<p>Fortunately, it is simple to go from markdown to HTML. The actual technique you use varies from editor to editor, and from\ntool to tool. But none of them are hard to use. That means you can write nice clean markdown, and still get HTML that you can use on the web: you get the best of both worlds.</p>\n<p>You can even include pictures.
